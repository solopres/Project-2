# SCOPE STATEMENT â€“ ZWEI
## Objectives
Developing a standard functioning UNO game that can be played by anyone. This game will implement both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer modes through an interactive user interface.
## Deliverables
A user interface for interacting with the game, a computer player, game handling for the UNO game rules, a management system that sorts out who is winning or losing. Calling UNO will be automatic
## Constraints
The timeline for this project is three weeks so ensuring we can put out something playable will be a huge constraint. We are also using Java which might have some technical limitations and most of the team members in the group are not really coders.
## Out of scope
Some out of scope functions include: multiplayer functionality, there will be no creating a custom card, only one machine can be used to play the UNO game and there will be no use of advanced graphics or animations.
