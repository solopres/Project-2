# Sprint 6: Connect Game Logic to GUI
**Goal:** 
- Establish a connection between the backend game logic and the frontend graphical user interface.

**Key Tasks Completed:**

- Created a GUIGameController class to act as the main communication bridge between the GUI and the core game logic.
- This controller handles data flow, updates the interface based on game state, and allows the GUI to send player actions back to the game logic.

**Outcome:**

- Successfully integrated core game mechanics into the GUI structure.
- Set up the foundation for user interactions to reflect real-time game logic
