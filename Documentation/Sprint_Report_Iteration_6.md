# Sprint 6: Connect Game Logic to GUI
**Goal:** 
- Establish a connection between the backend game logic and the frontend graphical user interface.

**Key Tasks Completed:**

- Created a GUIGameController class to act as the main communication bridge between the GUI and the core game logic.
- This controller handles data flow, updates the interface based on game state, and allows the GUI to send player actions back to the game logic.

**Outcome:**

- The game and the screen are now connected.
- This makes it possible for players to see the game working when they click or play.
