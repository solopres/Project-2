# Sprint 7: GUI Updates/ GUI Cards Display
**Goal:**

- Improve the user interface by connecting it with the new controller and allowing better card interaction.

**What I Did:**
 - updated the GamePlayPanel to use the new GUIGameController:
 - updated the PlayerHandView to allow card selection and better interaction:
 - modify CardView to make it easier to update and work with cards:
 - The GUI now successfully displays cards in a visually appealing and functional way
   
**Outcome:**
- The main gameplay screen is now connected to the controller, allowing smoother communication between the game and the interface.
- Players can now select cards directly in the interface.
- All cards are clearly visible
- Playable cards are highlighted
- Opponents' cards are hidden but countable
- Game state updates immediately after plays
- Special card effects are visually indicated
