# Sprint 7: GUI Updates/ display cards 
**Goal:**

- Improve the user interface by connecting it with the new controller and allowing better card interaction.

**What I Did:**
 - updated the GamePlayPanel to use the new GUIGameController:
 - updated the PlayerHandView to allow card selection and better interaction:
 - modify CardView to make it easier to update and work with cards:
   
**Outcome:**
- The main gameplay screen is now connected to the controller, allowing smoother communication between the game and the interface.
- Players can now select cards directly in the interface.
- The card display is easier to manage and update for future changes.
