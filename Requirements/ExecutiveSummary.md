Executive Summary

Describe the problem
The current problem that plagues people around the world is that they don’t have a version of UNO to play with others through Java! This results in things like boredom, unfulfillment, dementia, sadness, lack of joy, and dementia! Not only that, but there’s no option for people without friends to play a game of UNO by themselves! 

Process to solve the problem
The UNO Players will develop a game via Java that is set to fix the two major issues provided in the problem: the lack of an UNO based game coded with Java and the lack of a single player UNO. This will be done by using the Scrum version of the Agile software development life cycle. The team will go into around 8-9 sprints in order to coordinate, design, and implement deliverables to solve the main two problems previously mentioned.

Proposed solution
The current solution is called Swei. Swei will be a Java file that runs a game very similar to UNO. The basic rules will remain the same, but more complicated rules like “jumping in” or special features of the zero and seven will not be implemented. Swei will have the ability for player versus player as well as a player versus computer in later deliverables. The implementation of a GUI will be dependent on the success rate of previous sprints and is not guaranteed with the lack of time for the program’s completion.

Expected deliverables
We expect to have the following deliverables:
-A main / driver Java file that runs Swei
-Card class to make card objects
-Deck class to make a deck object
-Player class to make player objects
-File with card data to make card objects
Security Concerns
The three main concerns of security are:
	-Prevention and handling of bad user input (try and catch)
	-Prevention of file tampering (this would probably be a check to do in deck)
	-Prevention of buggy code that would cause the program to internally explode
