## What we Built
we created a card game called "Zwei" which is basically our own version of UNO. The game runs either in console mode or with a graphical interface.

## How It Works
When you start the program:
1. You see a welcome screen with two buttons: "Play Game" and "Exit"
2. Clicking "Play Game" takes you to the game board
3. The game board has spaces for:
   - Your cards at the bottom
   - Opponent cards at the top and sides
   - A deck to draw from
   - A discard pile in the center
